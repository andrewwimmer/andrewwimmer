                  <h2>A little bit about me.</h2>
                <div class="half-width">
                  <p>I’ve made my home base in Fort Worth, Texas with my small growing family. My journey into tech started as a logistics and supply chain manager implementing technologies in my organization. As I started gaining a technical knowledge I was fascinated with web development and how easily I could get my voice out there. I was hooked and wanted to learn how to build my own site to fit my own specific needs.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="half-width">
                  <p>That curiosity then opened a door, and when I learned how to build my first website, I realized I found something that gave me the freedom & versatility I was looking for in my work. Now, I help others put their voice on out there on the web, where I can use my organizational skills and eye for detail to write great code.</p>

                      <h3>Hand-Coded HTML</h3>
                        <p>My focus is writing clean, well-formatted, semantic HTML5 by hand to make sure that the content is easy to read, easy to collaborate, trouble-shoot and accessible.</p>

                      <h3>Well-Organized CSS</h3>
                        <p>I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read and build on. I focus on keeping my CSS lean and fast to load, and I make it a habit to stay up to date on current best practices.</p>
